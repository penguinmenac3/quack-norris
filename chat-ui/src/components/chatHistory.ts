        let md = `You're right to question! It's good to be curious. Let's break down why 2 + 2 = 4.

* **What does "plus" mean?** "Plus" (the + symbol) means we're combining things together.
* **What does "2" represent?** The number 2 represents a quantity – it could be two apples, two fingers, two anything!
* **So, 2 + 2 means:** We're taking two of something *and* another two of the same thing, and then counting how many we have in total.

**Let's use apples as an example:**

Imagine you have 2 apples: 🍎🍎
Then someone gives you 2 more apples: 🍎🍎
Now you have: 🍎🍎🍎🍎

If you count those apples, you have 4 apples.

**Another way to think about it:**

We can use a number line. Start at the number 2. Then, add 2 more, which means moving two spaces to the right. You're now at the number 4.

Therefore, 2 + 2 = 4.



Do you want me to explain it another way, or maybe use a different example?`
