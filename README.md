![picture of quack norris](images/duck_low_res.png)

Are you tired of spending hours ‚è≥ debugging your code? Look no further! Quack Norris ü¶Ü is here to save the day. This AImazing rubber duck will be your trusty AI companion ü§ñ, helping you tackle anything on your PC üíª.

**Agentic AI Core**: Experience agentic AI using any language model provider through this UI. This innovative platform allows tools and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) functionalities to be used with ease. ü§ñüí¨

## üë®‚Äçüíª Usage 

Visit https://penguinmenac3.github.io/quack-norris/ and install it as a web app.
Additionally you can use the [quack-norris-floaty](https://penguinmenac3.github.io/quack-norris-floaty/) to have the app available on your desktop at all times.

### Enable CORS for OLLAMA

When using ollama you have to enable CORS so that the app cann access it from the webui.
To achieve this, add `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*` to the environment variables.

### üé® Config

When you open the app for the first time, it will try to use your local ollama as an LLM provider.
If you do not have ollama or want to use any Open AI compatible LLM service, you can open the settings and configure your LLM connections there.

Additionally, you can configure connections to tool servers provided via the Open API standard.
To wrap MCP servers and make them available use [MCPO from Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/mcpo).

## üë• Contributing

Feel free to make this code better by forking, improving the code and then pull requesting.

I try to keep the dependency list of the repository as small as possible.
Hence, please try to not include unnescessary dependencies, just because they save you two lines of code.

When in doubt, if I will like your contribution, check the [.continuerules](.continuerules) for AI assistants.
The rules for AI will also apply to human contributors.
